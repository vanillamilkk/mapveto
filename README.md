# CS:GO Map Veto
This is the mapveto system written in php for KCML Community Cup. This is forked from crazyman10123's project and modified to suit our need.
If you are going to use this at all, you need to make major security modifications. When this was in use, everything was kept private and the web server was only on when it was being used by CCS staff.
